Me and two other geniuses took it upon ourselves to display the books for the town of K贸pavogur in a user friendly UI to increase transparency on how the town's finance is managed. The town of K贸pavogur was the first establishment in Iceland to open their books in this way but now many other towns and counties have followed suit. We used Angular.js on the client, Node.js on the server and a Python script to move the data from the towns SQL database into our super fast NoSQL ElasticSearch search engine.",
